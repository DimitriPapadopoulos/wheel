This library is the reference implementation of the Python wheel packaging
standard, as defined in `PEP 427`_.

As of setuptools v70.1, the ``bdist_wheel`` command is built into setuptools and
no longer requires wheel to be installed. This library now primarily serves as
a command line tool for working with wheel files.
